Description: systemd service controller for multi-node environments
 Eclipse BlueChi is a systemd service controller intended for multi-node
 environments with a predefined number of nodes and with a focus on
 highly regulated ecosystems such as those requiring functional
 safety (for example in cars).
 .
 BlueChi can also be used to control systemd services for containerized
 applications using Podman and its ability to generate systemd service
 configuration to run a container via quadlet.
 .
 This package contains the BlueChi agent, which manages services on the
 local machine.
